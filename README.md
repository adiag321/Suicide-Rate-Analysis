# <p align = "center"> Suicide Rate Analysis </p>

# Project Description

  From growing up in the heart of Silicon Valley, I have always wondered what was the factors that play a role in Suicide. There have been a plethora of suicide clusters from my High School in Palo Alto. This project seeks to explore the underlying factors. We will use a sample of 44,000 gather data from 141 different Countries, between the 80's to 2016. We would like to make a Machine Learning algorithm where we can train our AI to learn & improve from experience. Thus, we would want to predict the amount of suicides numbers in a certain demographic.


 # Overview
Data is collected from kaggle - <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016">Link</a>

In this mini-project, we will perform the following steps -
1.Data Wrangling <br>
2.Exploratory Data Analysis<br>
3.Machine Learning + Predictive Analytics <br>
4.Conclusions <br>
5.References <br>


Finally, I have generated a report to present my findings to the audience - <a href = "">Link</a>

# Questions

We will try to find the answers for the following questions during our analysis -

1. Which year has the most suicides ? Which year has the least suicides ?
2. Which country has the most suicides ? Which country has the least suicides ?
3. Are certain age groups more inclined to suicide?
4. What is the relationship between gender and the number of suicides?

# Conclusions

1. There was a decrease in suicides toward the 80's. This could be due to awareness of suicide & mental health in the 80s, as well as improved recogniztion of those at risk. But shortly after that their is a rise suicides that we are seeing.
2. Russian levels of alcohol consumption plays an immense role in it's large suicide count, but their is a lack of data to support this due to Soviet secrecy.
3. The data illustrates that middle aged adults, between the ages of 30 through 60, have the highest suicide count. While elderly and adolescents have about half the amount as middle aged adults.
4. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among all Americans adults. Data show alarming differences in suicide for different sexes. It's evident that males are more inclined to suicide, than females. In addition, Mental health is a major predictor for suicide.
